Background - My assignment for this task was the following:

You are the new Chief Data Scientist for your city's school district. In this capacity, you'll be helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

As a first task, I was been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. I was given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. My task was to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.
